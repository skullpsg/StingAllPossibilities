# StingAllPossibleCombinations
   All combination of string in C#  is the companion problem to find permutation of the string . The combination  generated from the algorithm has range in length from one to the  length of the string. 
   Two combinations that differ only in ordering of their characters are the same combination. In other words, "12" and "31" are different combinations from the input string "123", but "21" is the same as "12".
    
    

# Example
Let us understand the string combination algorithm with example :

 If the input is "wxyz"  then the output of the string is 

" w wx wxy wxyz wxz wy wyz wz x xy xyz xz y yz z "
